# Data Science 2016

Welcome to the Data Science class!

As a future data analyst, you are responsible to **collect**, **store**, **analyze** and effectively **report** on data insight.

In this class, we will be leaning how to clean up messy data, uncover patterns and insights to conclude or to make predictions. Moreover, we will be communicating our finding with beautiful visualization!

You are welcome to join the class chat room below with Gitter. I encourage all of you to ask questions publicly so that common questions can be answered once and for all.
