# Data Science 2016

Welcome to the Data Science class!

As a future data analyst, you are responsible to **collect**, **store**, **analyze** and effectively **report** on data insight.

In this class, we will be learning how to clean up messy data, uncover patterns and insights to conclude or to make predictions. Moreover, we will be communicating our findings with beautiful visualization!

You are welcome to join the class chat room below with [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/csula/datascience-spring-2016](https://badges.gitter.im/csula/datascience-spring-2016.svg)](https://gitter.im/csula/datascience-spring-2016?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge). I encourage all of you to ask questions publicly so that common questions can be answered once and for all.

In this quarter, we will publish all course materials on the Github and on [Gitbook][1]. This implies you don't need a textbook for the class as all required materials will be provided here.

> Please feel free to utilize Github issue or Gitbook comment to share your thoughts on the course throughout the quarter
