# Data Science

## Course Overview

**Objectives**

The primary goal for Data Science class is to collect, store, analyze and visualize data for answering third level question (holy grail of the data science). 

Students will be required to perform various programming parts in order to accomplish the final course project for reporting finding.

**Expectations**

We expect students to have strong Java programming background as the course programming will be built around Java. And some Python programming is required through out the course for Machine Learning.

Moreover, we expect students to spend large amount of time learning new tools and implementing the project parts outside of course schedule.
