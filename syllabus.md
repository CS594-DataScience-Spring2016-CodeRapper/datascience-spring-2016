# Data Science

## Course Overview

**Objectives**

The primary goal for this Data Science class is to collect (acquire), store, analyze and visualize data for answering questions pertaining to *the third order of knowledge*.

Students will perform programming parts throughout the quarter to finish the final course project.

**Expectations**

We expect students to have strong Java programming background with some Python programming experience.  

Moreover, we expect students to spend large amount of time learning new tools and coding outside of course schedule.

Finally, the programming assignments are non-trivial for a number of reasons, students are expected to understand and develop programs that have varying algorithmic complexities.  To this end, leaving the homework assignments to the last minute is a surefire way to *not* pass the course.

## Grading Allocation

* Homework - 40%
* Quizzes - 40%
* Project - 20%
  > Successful completion of the course project is a need for passing this course.
* Attendance & demeanor - 5%
  > We expect you to show civility and concerns for your classmates.  We expect for you to approach the class with a positive attitude and professional demeanor.  This includes remaining alert (and awake!) in class, respecting and never interrupting others, limiting private conversations, and keeping phones off.  Because the class is a fast-pace and demanding class, there will be opportunities an overwhelmed feeling.  The best way to address these challenges is to discuss the course on gitter and with the instructors.

### Grading Scale

* A: 94% to 105%
* A-: 90% to 93%
* B+: 85% to 89%
* B: 80% to 84%
> Graduate students are required to get a grade 80 or above to pass the course
* B-: 77% to 79%
* C+: 74% to 76%
* C: 70% to 73%
> Undergraduate students are required to obtain a grade 70 or above to pass the course
* F: 0% to 69%
