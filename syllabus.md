# Data Science

## Course Overview

**Objectives**

The primary goal for this Data Science class is to collect (acquire), store, analyze and visualize data for answering questions pertaining to *the third order of knowledge*.

Students will perform programming parts throughout the quarter to finish the final course project.

**Expectations**

We expect students to have strong Java programming background with some Python programming experience.  

Moreover, we expect students to spend large amount of time learning new tools and coding outside of course schedule.

Finally, the programming assignments are non-trivial for a number of reasons, students are expected to understand and develop programs that have varying algorithmic complexities.  To this end, leaving the homework assignments to the last minute is a surefire way to *not* pass the course.

## Logistics

Instructor-in-charge:

  * Eric Liao <rcliao01@gmail.com>

Course assistant:

  * John Tran <johnjtran@icloud.com>

Schedule:

  * Undergrad: Sunday 9:10 to 13:00 at ET-A309
  * Grad: Sunday 13:10 to 17:00 at BIOS-144

Office hour:

* Sunday 17:00 to 19:00 at BIOS-144

Textbook:

Students do not need to purchase a textbook for this class as this Github will provide all course material.

Computer:

Students are required to have a laptop computer for the course.  On some assignments and certainly for the final project where a live demo is required, it is unreasonable to coordinate with anything other than a laptop.

We do not endorse a particular platform or OS; however, we encourage students to pick something that has reasonable computing horsepower.  For this reason, chromebooks or tablets are not suitable for serious software development and data processing.

## Grading Policy

The purpose of this grading policy is to fairly evaluate student's performance.  Please review them carefully.

### Grading Allocation

* Homework - 40 points
* Quizzes - 40 points
* Project - 20 points
* Attendance & decorum - 5 points (more below)

### Grading Scale

The final grade will be adjusted to a 100 point scale as followed.

* A: 94 to 100
* A-: 90 to 93
* B+: 85 to 89
* B: 80 to 84
> Graduate students are required to get a grade 80 or above to pass the course
* B-: 77 to 79
* C+: 74 to 76
* C: 70 to 73
> Undergraduate students are required to obtain a grade 70 or above to pass the course
* F: 0 to 69

Successful completion of the course project is needed for passing this course.

### Course Decorum

We expect you to show civility and concerns for your classmates.  We expect for you to approach the class with a positive attitude and professional demeanor.  

> This includes remaining alert (and awake!) in class, respecting and never interrupting others, limiting private conversations, and keeping phones off.  

Because the class is a fast-pace and demanding class, there will be opportunities for an overwhelmed feeling.  The best way to address these challenges is to discuss the course on gitter and with the instructors.  Please ask for help often and early.

The instructors are obligated to listen to the students' concerns and to treat each student with the needed respect and dignity.  However, the instructors are not obligated to honor any and all requests.  Especially in those cases students ask for assistance during the 11th hour.

#### Request for a Regrade

* In those cases of arithmetic errors, please bring the issue to the instructor-in-charge immediately.  We will make the necessary adjustments (no questions asked).  

* In those cases where **students feel that they should get more because ___**.  PLEASE DO NOT BOTHER.  We will listen to your plight, but we will not regrade.  

  ___ includes (but not limited to):

	* They worked really hard on the assignment or project
	* They would have to endure shame with family and friends
	* They need _XYZ_ grade to graduate


* In those cases where students believe that the grade rendered does not reflect the quality of the work, students must submit in writing within 1 week a request for regrade with the following information:

  - Name and CIN number
  - Assignment #/Exam #/Project
  - Specific problem #
  - Clearly articulated rationale with supporting data to backup your claim

We will review your request for a regrade and respond accordingly.  Please note that as a matter of principle the **entire** assignment, exam, or project will be evaluated.  This is because, more often than none, our grading methods are generous to begin with and that we always give students the benefit of doubt.

> It is entirely possible that a regrade request can result in an overall lower score for the assignment or exam.  With respect to the course project or the final grade, it is possible that students can actually fail the course.  Please do the proper risk reward analysis.


## Academic Integrity

Cheating will not be tolerated.  All parties involved will receive a grade of **F for the course** and be reported to the Computer Science Department.

To be clear, let us define cheating:

> Cheating is taking and receiving unauthorized assistance on an assignment, exam, or project.  Which is essentially claiming that work that belongs to someone else to be your own; or giving the solution to someone else.

Over the years, we have developed a number of strategies and techniques to identify cheating.  The biggest tell-tail sign of cheating is not understanding your solution and/or source code.  Second, we have automated tools for source code analysis.  To this extent, simply reformatting source code or renaming variables is pointless.

> The bottomline: don't cheat, if you are caught cheating,  all parties involved would simply get an F for course.  This is not negotiable.  So please do the proper risk reward analysis.

Please note that we do not discourage discussion and collaboration.  However, we are very adamant that you utilize the class's discussion board and office hours for this purpose.

Reasonable accommodation will be provided to any student who is registered with the Office of Students with Disabilities and requests needed accommodation.
